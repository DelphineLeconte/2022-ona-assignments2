## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Installing and loading tidyverse

install.packages("tidyverse")

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
